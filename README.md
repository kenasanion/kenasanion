## How I work

I'm trying my best to follow at least a system or some sort of habit of doing things earlier. I do procrastinate but I hate it. However, when I do procrastinate my productivity is 120%.
As much as possible, I cannot work properly when there's constant pressure around me to finish things. Give me a freedom to do things then I'll finish it with quality.
